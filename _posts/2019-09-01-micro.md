We conducted training on a GAN with the purpose of generating city structures within the virtual environment of the game "Micropolis." Our primary objective was to evaluate the generator's ability to produce city layouts that adhere to the game's specific requirements. To gauge the effectiveness of the generator, we compared the cities it generated with those obtained through a genetic algorithm that was guided by the game's scoring function.
