We designed and implemented a functional shark detection pipeline that combines deep learning techniques, such as a multiscale convolutional networks for underwater image-based shark detection and an adversarial framework for domain adaptation. The pipeline incorporates a network of real-time underwater cameras, enabling efficient shark detection and immediate communication of alerts to on-ground sites. Currently, the pipeline is undergoing testing by the CSR in La Reunion Island to validate its effectiveness.
