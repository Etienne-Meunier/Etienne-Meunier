We designed a functional shark detection pipeline that combines deep learning techniques for underwater image-based shark detection and an adversarial framework for domain adaptation. The pipeline incorporates a network of real-time underwater cameras, enabling efficient shark detection and immediate communication of alerts to on-ground sites. The pipeline is undergoing testing by the CSR in La Reunion Island.
